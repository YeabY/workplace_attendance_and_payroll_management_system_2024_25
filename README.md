# Workplace Management System

Why MySQL?

We chose MySQL as the database for the Workplace Management System because it efficiently handles structured and relational data. Features like employee records, attendance, payroll, and role-based access rely on well-defined relationships and constraints. MySQL ensures data integrity, supports complex queries for reporting, and is a reliable, scalable solution for systems requiring consistency and structure.
## Features
- **Authentication**: Secure login system with JWT-based authentication.
- **Role-based Access**: Admin and user roles for customized functionality.
- **Employee Management**: Add, edit, and manage employee information.
- **Attendance Management**: Record daily attendance, clock in/out functionality, and calculate work hours.
